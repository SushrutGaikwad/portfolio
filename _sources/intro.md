## 💼 Work Experience  

### **Master's Thesis Student (Intern)**
Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, India
*December 2021 - December 2022*
- Contributed to significant research projects aimed at improving air quality forecasting and understanding environmental hazards.
- Developed predictive models for stubble burning events, a major anthropogenic source of air pollution in the Delhi-Punjab-Haryana region. This involved analyzing historical data and leveraging spatiotemporal deep learning techniques to forecast future occurrences, aiming to mitigate the adverse effects on air quality.
- Worked on predicting forest fires in the northeast and central regions of India. This project included data collection, data cleaning and preprocessing, model development, and validation, intending to support forest management strategies.
- Applied various time series forecasting algorithms, including ARIMA and LSTM, to air pollution data from New Delhi. My work helped in understanding the temporal patterns of air pollutants and in developing more accurate forecasting models to predict pollution levels.
